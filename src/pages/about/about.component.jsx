                Hi there! I am <strong>&nbsp;Kartikay Jain</strong>
                <br />I was born in Mumbai, India and did my primary school education there. In 2011, my family moved to Singapore where I finished the rest of my schooling. In 2017, I started my undergraduate studies at Cornell University where I am pursuing Computer Science, Statistical Science and Mathematics. My expected graduation date is May 2022. I love learning new technologies and I am passionate about using Data Science and Machine Learning to solve challenging problems.
                {/* <br />
                Along with that, I also help people as a COACH on their journey of becoming a professional programmer. 
                <br />I love learning about new technologies, what problems are they solving and How can I use them to build better and scalable products. */}
